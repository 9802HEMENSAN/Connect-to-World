Title: Full Stack Development Project â€“ Personalized News Hub
Objective: Develop a personalized news platform that provides users with news articles
based on their preferences, using a public news API and your preferred full-stack
technologies.
Background: In today's information age, staying updated with the latest news is crucial.
However, sifting through the vast amounts of news articles available can be overwhelming.
Your task is to create a platform that curates news articles based on the user's interests.
Scope: The system should include the following features:

1. User Registration and Authentication: Implement a registration and login system
   for users.
2. Interest Selection: Users should be able to select and update their interests (e.g.,
   technology, sports, politics, health).
3. News Feed: The main page should display a feed of news articles curated based on
   the user's selected interests. This can be done using a public news API such as
   NewsAPI or GNews.
4. Article Saving: Users should have the option to save articles to read later.
5. Article Recommendation: Based on the user's reading habits, recommend articles
   they might be interested in.
   Technical Requirements:
6. Front-end: Use React.js for Frontends and your UI should be user-friendly and
   responsive.
7. Back-end: Use Framework like Node.js
8. Database: You can use a relational NoSQL database such as MongoDB
9. APIs: Aside from the public news API, build RESTful APIs for the front-end to interact
   with the back-end.
10. Version Control: Use Git for version control. The final code should be hosted on a
    public repository on GitHub.
    Evaluation Criteria:
11. Cleanliness and organization of the code.
12. The functionality of each feature.
13. Aesthetics and responsiveness of the UI.
14. The choice and proper usage of data structures, algorithms, and design patterns.
15. Documentation: Include a README file in the repository that contains instructions on
    how to setup and run your application, and also explain the architecture of your
    application, the decisions you made, and the reasons behind them.
    Submission Deadline: 10 Aug
    Remember, this assignment is designed to assess your technical skills, problem-solving
    abilities, and creativity. We're excited to see what you come up with!
    Good luck
